Creating a static website using AWS services like S3 (Simple Storage Service), Route 53, ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager), and CloudFront is a straightforward process. A static website consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files that don't require server-side processing.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a static website using these services:

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the S3 service.
   - Click on the "Create bucket" button.
   - Provide a globally unique bucket name and choose the region.
   - Uncheck "Block all public access" (for now, as we will make the bucket public for website hosting).
   - Click through the remaining options and create the bucket.

2. **Upload Your Website Files**:
   - Once the bucket is created, open it and upload your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the bucket. Make sure to set the appropriate permissions to make the files publicly accessible. You can do this by selecting the files and clicking on the "Actions" dropdown, then choosing "Make public."

3. **Configure S3 for Website Hosting**:
   - In the S3 bucket properties, navigate to the "Static website hosting" section.
   - Choose the "Use this bucket to host a website" option.
   - Enter the "Index document" (usually "index.html") and, optionally, an "Error document."
   - Save the configuration.

4. **Request an SSL Certificate using ACM**:
   - Go to the ACM service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Request a certificate."
   - Follow the prompts to request a certificate for your website domain (e.g., www.example.com).
Click on Certicate, click create record, once certificate is validated and issued, it is ready to use

5. **Create a CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Go to the CloudFront service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Create Distribution."
   - Choose "Web" for the delivery method.
   - In the "Origin Settings," paste the s3 bucket you created endpoint.
   - In the "Default Cache Behavior Settings," choose "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS."
   - If you requested an SSL certificate in ACM, select "Custom SSL Certificate" and choose the certificate for your domain.
   - In the "Distribution Settings," configure the CNAME (e.g., www.example.com) and other settings as needed.
   - Create the distribution.

6. ** Route 53 **:
   - Go to the Route 53 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Select the hosted zone corresponding to your domain (e.g., example.com).
   - Click on "Create Record Set" and add an "A" record with an alias to your CloudFront distribution. If you are using "www.example.com," create a record for "www" pointing to your CloudFront distribution.

7. **Wait for DNS Propagation**:
   - DNS changes may take some time to propagate across the internet. Wait for the changes to take effect, which usually takes a few minutes to an hour.

After following these steps, your static website should be accessible through your domain name and served securely through CloudFront.
